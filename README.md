# Scholarlink: Scholar Information System of Gado and Jess Jalandoni Scholarship Project

## Introduction

Scholarlink is a proposed system developed by the See Solutions Team aimed at supporting the Gado and Jess Jalandoni Scholarship Project (GJJSP) Team, under the Assisi Development Foundation, Inc. The system is designed to address the challenges of managing scholar information and streamlining submission processes, thereby enhancing the GJJSP's capacity to make significant human capital investments by offering deserving Filipino students the opportunity to pursue college education.

## Project Context

The GJJSP, a special project by the Assisi Development Foundation, aims to uplift poor Filipinos through investments in human capital, focusing on social inclusion and ensuring positive outcomes. With its extensive reach across multiple regions and institutions, the project has significantly impacted many lives but faces challenges in managing the vast amount of scholar information using traditional tools like Microsoft Excel. This has led to inefficiencies such as data duplication, errors, and a lack of effective data visualization for decision-making.

## Statement Of the Problem

Scholarlink addresses the following challenges faced by the GJJSP Team:

1. Inefficient submission processes and communication delays.
2. Reliance on manual processes for managing scholar data, leading to inconsistencies and time-consuming data management.
3. Lack of data visualization in reports, affecting decision-making.
4. Difficulty in maintaining up-to-date contact information for scholars.

## Objectives

The primary goal of Scholarlink is to develop and implement a Scholar Information System that:

- Enhances Scholar Information Management.
- Ensures data accessibility.
- Simplifies the submission process for efficient operations.

## Significance Of the Study

The significance of Scholarlink extends to various stakeholders, including the GJJSP Team, scholars, scholar managers, and future developers, by providing operational efficiency, streamlined data management, and a user-friendly platform for managing scholarship requirements.

## Scope And Limitations

Scholarlink focuses exclusively on managing scholar information for the GJJSP Team, with core features like document upload, email reminders, scholar profile management, and report generation. While some features are considered optional, such as scholarship application management and a project partner portal, others like alumni networking and financial disbursement are excluded from the project's scope.
